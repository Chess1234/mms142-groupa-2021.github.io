				<h1>MMS142 GROUP A DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY : EDGE COMPUTING</h1>

				<h2>"The principle is straightforward: If you can't get the data closer to the data center, get the data center closer to the data."</h2>
				<h3> - Stephen Bigelow </h3>

				<h1>What is Edge Computing</h1>
				<p>Edge Computing is an "alternative" way to compute, store, and process data. It is set in between the device and the cloud to help lessen latency and increase computing and analysis speed.</p>

				<h3> “Edge computing brings processing capabilities closer to the end-user/device/source of data which eliminates the journey to the cloud data centre and reduces latency.” - Dalia Adib </h3>

			</div>
			<div class="benefits">
				<h1>BENEFITS OF EDGE COMPUTING</h1>
					<ul> Speed - Multiple localized micro data centers = less reliance on cloud data centers which avoids bandwidth traffic, latency issues, etc. </ul>
					<ul> Security - Decentralized computing architecture makes it harder for attacks to be devastating (malware, phishing, DDOS) as the processes, storages, and applications are spread across multiple localized data centers.</ul>
					<ul> Scalability - It is not demanding in terms of resources compared to having to maintain a fully-pledged data center that needs proper maintenance and substantial bandwidth allocation. </ul>
					<ul> Versatility - By having edge data centers, it is possible to make changes depending on the end-users preference or target a market trend without completely altering the IT infrastructure.</ul>
					<ul> Reliability - Edge computing chases almost all loose ends of a centralized data center. It reduces the risk of complete collapse of the server in case of an outage, data can be rerouted through multiple gateways that increases the speed of which you get the information and it increases efficiency of data exchange between two machines. </ul>

				<h1>EDGE VS CLOUD</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="vsleft">
				Cloud computing in the most simplest form is any computing processes that are done via the internet. All the data are accessed, stored, and processed through the web which are all located in a massive storage system of data called data centers.
			</div>
			<div class="vsright">
				Edge computing on the other hand, can be seen as sort of the "middleman" that places all the computing resources closer to the user instead of having to travel from the main server and back which can cause latency issues. It is like storing it in a cache memory for later use. Edge computing is a game-breaking concept that when it is implemented alongside what we have now which is cloud computing, can solve a lot of security risks, delays, and better user experience.

				<h1> HOW EDGE COMPUTING THEN DISRUPTIVE </h1>
			</div>
			<div class="disruptive">
				what is disruptive?
					<ul> takes time (to become mainstream)</ul>
					<ul> offers something unique</ul>
					<ul> when entrepreneurs offer a service that more or less is similar to existing services except, with additional features </ul>
			</div>
			<div class="disruptivehow">
				How is Edge Computing Disruptive?
					<ul>it is currently under research and many beta testing. That said, it'll take time for it to be set for public use.</ul>
